			International School of Management and Technology (ISMT) is located at Tinkune, Kathmandu. It offers internationally recognized British Degrees for those who seek an affordable route to a British Degree without compromising on the quality.For the prospect development of this server there is the preference (like chassis dimension, power supply requirement video requirement, etc.) that helps to make the server extra advance and assessable in the future in order to use. For further enhancement of networked system, we would advocate to upgrade the old routers, switches and keep back-up of the server daily. We would recommend using firewall for the security. Instead of using Windows server operating system we would recommend to use Linux Server operating system so that the server will be more secured. We will recommend using number of security cameras to provide better security in the IT Company. We will recommend using Child Domain Controller (CDC) which helps domain by reducing the load of Primary Domain Controller (PDC). Linux server operating system can be used for system auditing. We would recommend checking firmware or software updates to keep network advanced. We would recommend using Remote Access Service (RAS) only when required otherwise invader can control the network system remotely. We would recommend keeping very tough password in server system and keeping NTFS Security to important data files and folders. We would recommend purchasing the fortification (Protection) like malware blocking, spamming filtering, phishing blocking, antivirus software and creating the good defense background in Our IT Company.

							Step1: First of all network essential like router, server computer, switch, printer, firewall, VPN tunnel and workstation where place up.
				Step2: after that we disperse IP addresses to our server OS.
					Step3: We linked workstation and server computer through switch.
			Step4: next switch was attached to router, then firewall and to wireless access point to access the internet.
			Step5: VPN server is used to join with computer of branch office.
			Step6: VPN server was connected to switch, then router and firewall to supply high security for the data.
			Step7: Then VPN tunnel is used to pass the information security by encrypting data.
			Step8: Firewall then connected to router, router to switch of branch office.
			Step9: Then switch was connected to VPN server, VPN server to switch which was connected to the server like DHCP, Print Server, RODC, CDC, etc. to be in touch with servers of head office.
			Step10: Then it is linked to next switch which is associated to different department workstation like IT department, Head office, Front desk and Cash Department.

			Internet protocol version four is fourth version of the internet protocol and currently used version of IP address. It’s the type of protocol which is based on standard-base internetworking method in the internet. It’s connectionless protocol which is used on packet-switching networks. It uses 32 bits numeric address which is printed as four numbers alienated by dots and has limitation address space up to 232 addresses. It consists of 4 octets of the address which is spoken individually in decimal numbers and each octet is separated by dots. The total number of IPv4 addresses ranges from 000.000.000.000 to 255.255.255.255. IPv4 reserves special address block for private network and multicast address which seems like large in number but it’s not enough for the entire device connected to internet world.

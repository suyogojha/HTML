 		<h1 class="html">COMPUTER NETWORKING</h1>

 		<P class="auto">Computer networks have become the essence of our daily lives. Computer networks are the driving force behind the evolution of computer systems allowing users to access data, hardware and services regardless of their location. The major purpose of this assignment is to provide the students an opportunity to exhibit their knowledge in the field of computer networking, how the network operates, protocols, standards, security considerations and the prototypes associated with a range of networking technologies. The assignment will help the students to check their knowledge for configuring and installation of networking system exploring the range of technologies and troubleshooting the network. The students will be able to demonstrate their skills and understandings over the operation of IP data networks, router, switching technologies, IP routing technologies, IP services and troubleshooting through the completion of this assignment. <br>
		Besides technical stuffs, the students will be demonstrating their skills such as communication literacy, critical thinking, analysis, reasoning and interpretation, which are crucial for gaining employment and developing academic competence.</P>




		<pre><p class="com"> <b> Scenario I A newly IT company named LANDMARK IT Pvt. Ltd is going to be opened in Nepal. The head office will be located in KTM, Tilganga & will have 20 branch offices over the country. <br> It will provide different IT related services for different types of organization like School, Bank, Colleges, INGO, NGO etc. Some of the main services can be listed as follows:</b>
			1. Sales and maintenance of different types of computers and related devices.
			2. Peer -to- peer & client server network setup.
			3. Annual maintenance contract
			4. Configuration of different server services like DC, RODC, CDC, DHCP, DNS, IIS, Web, Proxy, Telnet, RADIUS, Authentication etc.
			5. Configuration of routers and Switches of different vendors like Cisco, Juniper, Mikrotiketc
			6. Configuration of firewalls of different vendors like Cisco, Juniper, Fortigate etc.
			7. Maintenance, upgrade & troubleshooting of different network systems.</p></pre>





			<p class="csss">This document considered the description of networking principle and their protocols along with their benefits and constraint. Here, we also have described about the impact of network topology beside with networking principles and their effectiveness along that we have also chosen best topology protocol for the effortless experience of networking system. <br> Basically, network is the Groups of computers, mainframes, servers, peripherals, network devices or extra devices that are related in order to divide resources (such as printers and CDs), exchange files, or allow electronic communications and Some of the network systems are peer-to-peer(P2P), client server, cloud, virtual etc. Moreover we have also explained about topology which is commonly known as arrange pattern of computer in physical form. Some of them are Star, Ring, Bus, and Mesh topology. <br> Further, we have explained more about protocol. Protocol are generally defined as the set of rules and guidelines that computer used to communicate data. Some of the protocols are TCP/IP, UDP, SMTP, HTTP, FTP etc. Similarly, we have also defined about different networking devices and server type, Inter-dependence of workstation hardware and range of server types and its selection in term of cost, performance and other scenario. Basically, networking standards are the protocols for data communication and networking topology device. Some of them are IEEE 802, IETF RFC1918 etc. <br>we have also explained about server. Generally, server is responsible to manage network resources and provide services to the client. Similarly, much other documentation has been made during the entire project. As I am IT person, so I have to use different networking principles, server system, IP addressing, security device and protocol which all those needed documenting has been made in this document.</p>

				<h1 class="sec1">Database</h1>

				<p class="sec2">
					The database is a single, possibility large repository of data that can be used simultaneously by many departments and user. Instead of disconnected files with redundancy data, all data item are integrated with a minimum amount of duplication. In the earlier age, peoples and even bigger companies like Bank, Governmental office, etc. used to record data in traditional form i.e. “handwritten form”. <br> The modern technology was invented dramatically day by day as time passed and because of this great achievement in the field of internet and computer science, a new age of recording/keeping data system was started. Now in this modern scientific era, we are using different kinds of data storing hardware and software. The database brings change in the field of data/information recording. <br> A shared collection of logically related data, and a description of this data, designs to meet the information needs of an organization. <br>
					The process taken with database system, where the definition of data is dividing from the application programs, is similar to the approach taken in current software development, where an internal definition of an object and a separate outer definition are provided. (connolly, 2014). The database is the collection of information and data organized to provide efficient retrieval. <br>The database represents the organization, the attributes, and the logical connection between the entities. The collected information’s and data should be in any number and formats. Data is organized in rows, columns, and tables and recorded to find the easier way to applicable information. <br> The older data gets updated, expanded and deleted as the newer data takes place on it or newer data gets updated. The database is used for storing data. They help in storing the special information that is used for managing the data. They can solve the cases where many users want possibly to change the same data that has entered. (oracle)

				<h2 class="sec3">Relational Database Management System (RDMS)</h2>

				<p class="sec4">
					The Relational Database is a common type of database whose data is stored in the format of rows and columns and is a set of programs and operating systems that create and maintain the collection of relevant information, data, records, and etc. The databases usually used these days in business are relational databases, as against to a smooth file or hierarchical database. Generally, RDMS is based on Create, Read/Retrieve, Update and Delete (CRUD) functions. It brings a systematic way to understand the source code to the user and execution of queries. Relational databases have the smack to handle host data and complex queries, whereas a flat file takes up more extent and memory, and is less efficient. So, the modern databases use multiple tables as standard. (techtarget, 2016)

				<h3 class="sec5">Entity</h3>


				<p class="sec6">
					An entity is any singular, identifiable and separate object, which can differentiate from other object based on their values of the attributes possess in a real-world scenario. It is a real-world object (like Person, Organization, business, etc.) with their properties which describes the characteristics of an object. It mentions to individuals, organizations, and systems, bits of data or even clear system components that are considered notable in and of them. An entity holds members like attributes. Without attributes, an entity cannot be described. For example, Student Information, Books, Author, Type etc. The label is used in a number of programming languages/concepts, database management, systems design and other theatre. (study)
